To test how the 8 layer model, regarding Hiera key lookups,
functions, we have created a Puppet module called test.

In the local test directory, a YAML structure is presented
which can be installed on an empty node. Empty, with respect
to Puppet provisioning.

Copy the structure from the test subdirectory:
# cd test
# rsync -rR * /var/lib/hiera
