# AB: we use the man pages of NTP, see man ntp.conf, and the
# website: http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/WebHome.

# AB: this is the configuration for the stratum 2 NTP
# clients. Stratum 0 is the reference time (UTC of 300
# atomic clocks, which are connected). Stratum 1 are our
# special NTP servers with a local clock, connected via
# Satellite or Radio to stratum 0. Stratum 2 NTP servers
# connect to the stratum 1 servers and are peered with other
# stratum 2 servers.

# AB: we don't use a file with leap seconds since it
# requires the use of the autokey command which needs the
# cryptography of NTP being set up. The NTP server will
# adapt to the timeservers, thus overcoming the missed leap
# seconds.

# Permit time synchronization with our time source, but do not
# permit the source to query or modify the service on this system.
restrict default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery

# AB: restrict is the general purpose restriction list of
# ntpd. ntpd sorts it in two columns: IP and IP mask in
# ascending order. So: 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 and
# 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0 are sorted as:
# 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0 and 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0. If
# a masked source IP address matches the masked network
# address, then the last match determines the restriction
# rules. For example: source IP 192.168.0.1 matches first
# 192.168/16, and then 192.168.0/24, so the last
# (192.168.0/24) determines the restrictions. restrict
# default means: restrict 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0, so everything is
# matched.

# The restriction options are (man ntp_acc):
# * ignore, not used, everything from the client is ignored
# * kod, kiss of death to shut down a misbehaving client
# * limited, not used
# * lowpriotrap, not used since not understood
# * nomodify, prohibit ntpq and ntpdc to modify the state of
#   ntpd
# * noquery, prohibit ntpq and ntpdc to query ntpd
# * nopeer, no new peer association can be started, only the
#   configured ones
# * noserve, not used
# * notrap, used for remote event loggers
# * notrust, not used, only for cryptographic associations
# * ntpport, not used
# * version, only version 4

# Permit all access over the loopback interface.  This could
# be tightened as well, but to do so would effect some of
# the administrative functions.

# Use public servers from the pool.ntp.org project.
# Please consider joining the pool (http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html).
# AB: default time servers commented out:

#server 1.rhel.pool.ntp.org

# AB: a list of all configuration command options is given
# (man ntp.conf). The commands are:
# * server
# * peer
# * broadcast
# * manycastclient
# The command options are:
# * autokey, we don't use cryptography, irrelevant
# * burst, not recommended with minpoll=6 and maxpoll=10
# * iburst, recommended for the server command
# * key, we don't use cryptography, irrelevant
# * minpoll, default value of 6 used
# * maxpoll, default value of 10 used
# * noselect, not used
# * preempt, not used
# * prefer, not used, maybe later, depending on the
#   geographic distribution of the time servers and the node
#   using this configuration file
# * not used, too complicated to understand
# * not used, only for broad- and manycast
# * version, defaults to 4, which is good
