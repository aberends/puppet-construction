puppet-construction
===================

Repo mapping on software channel containing RPM's with Puppet modules

In the Puppet construction layer, we focus on writing elementary Puppet modules. So, providing the mechanism to make something work. See for a full explanation on [msat.disruptivefoss.org](http://msat.disruptivefoss.org/). In the puppet-integration repo and corresponding layer, Puppet integration, we tie together the parameters coming from YAML files to the elementary Puppet modules from the Puppet construction layer.
